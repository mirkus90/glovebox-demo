1.	Preparation:
•	Set up the round bottom flask on the stir plate.
•	Attach the reflux condenser to the flask.
2.	Experiment Steps:
•	Step 1: Add benzene to the round bottom flask.
•	Step 2: Add a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid to the flask.
•	Step 3: Turn on the stir plate to start the reaction.
•	Step 4: Allow the reaction to proceed for a specified time (e.g., 1 minute for methylbenzene, 3 minutes for benzaldehyde).
•	Step 5: Observe the formation of nitrobenzene and other products.
3.	Observation:
•	Note down any observations during the experiment, such as the rate of bubble formation and color changes.
4.	Data Collection:
•	Record the time taken for the reaction to complete and the amount of nitrobenzene formed.
5.	Analysis:
•	Analyze the products using techniques such as gas chromatography (GC) to determine the composition and yield of nitrobenzene.
6.	Conclusion:
•	Summarize the findings of the experiment.
•	Example: The experiment shows that nitration of benzene produces nitrobenzene through electrophilic aromatic substitution.
Cleanup:
•	Dispose of chemicals as per the lab's safety guidelines.
•	Clean and store equipment properly.
